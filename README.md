Cyber Drishti 👁️
An anonymous platform for sharing and learning from real-world cyber incident stories.

Cyber Drishti provides a safe space for victims of cybercrime to anonymously share their experiences.
A guided AI chatbot helps them structure their story, which is then anonymized and published to educate others.

## 🚀 Problem

Cybercrime is a multi-trillion-dollar issue, yet an estimated 85% of incidents go unreported (U.S. DOJ).

Victims stay silent due to:

Shame or embarrassment

Fear of being blamed

Belief that authorities won’t help

Not knowing where to report

This creates a severe awareness gap, allowing attackers to repeat the same scams.
